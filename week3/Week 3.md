# Date Functionality in Pandas


```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```

### Timestamp


```python
pd.Timestamp('9/1/2016 10:05AM')
```




    Timestamp('2016-09-01 10:05:00')



### Period


```python
pd.Period('1/2016')
```




    Period('2016-01', 'M')




```python
pd.Period('3/5/2016')
```




    Period('2016-03-05', 'D')



### DatetimeIndex


```python
t1 = pd.Series(list('abc'), [pd.Timestamp('2016-09-01'), pd.Timestamp('2016-09-02'), pd.Timestamp('2016-09-03')])
t1
```

    2016-09-02    b
    2016-09-03    c
    dtype: object




```python
type(t1.index)
```




    pandas.tseries.index.DatetimeIndex



### PeriodIndex


```python
t2 = pd.Series(list('def'), [pd.Period('2016-09'), pd.Period('2016-10'), pd.Period('2016-11')])
t2
```




    2016-09    d
    2016-10    e
    2016-11    f
    Freq: M, dtype: object




```python
type(t2.index)
```




    pandas.tseries.period.PeriodIndex



### Converting to Datetime


```python
d1 = ['2 June 2013', 'Aug 29, 2014', '2015-06-26', '7/12/16']
ts3 = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randint(10, 100, (4,2)), index=d1, columns=list('ab'))

### Timedeltas


```python

```




    Timedelta('2 days 00:00:00')




```python

```python
